No special instructions to run the program. Simply open up index.html file in a web browser and enjoy! The development PDF is also on the website, as well as a user guide (just click “Help”). 

To get the PDF documentation, since it would not fit on dropbox alone or in a zip file with the rest of the program, please download my zip file for this assignment at this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0n1gukkkr5vg4o/hg2287_assn3.zip

Thank you very much,
